This version is based off of an RSI (relative strength index.)

Pros:
- Invests when the rsi is oversold
- Sells when the rsi is overbought

Cons:
- If the price drops without being classified as "oversold" by the algorithm, it'll result in a profit loss, or even investment loss.
- Will only work efficienty with large sums of money
- Only works to its full potential when it is held online for long peridos of time (e.g days-weeks)

May need consant maintenance to make sure it doesnt make you lose alot fo money.
